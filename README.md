# artist-skeleton-website
Dynamic PHP skeleton website for artists

This project was completed alongside a Udemy course in PHP by Jazeb Akram as my inspiration, as well as a Udemy course entitled "A Guide to Creating a Professional Artist's Website" by DBTV Studios.
It makes use of the HTML5 Boilerplate (version 8.0.0) and Bootstrap 3.4.1.
All of the CSS from Akram's Basic.css file has been removed and replaced with the necessary Bootstrap CSS for the top navigation bar.
The non-Bootstrap CSS in all files have been left in to serve as placeholders. Users are free to do as they wish to make the skeleton work for them while acknowledging the relevant license holders.
